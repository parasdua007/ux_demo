# Reltio Console UX Demo

This repository contains a UX demo for the Reltio Console Usage Reporting interface. The demo showcases a modern, responsive web interface with interactive features.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Open directly in browser (Recommended)
Simply open the `final-entitlement-summary.html` file in any modern web browser:
- Double-click the HTML file
- Or drag and drop it into your browser window
- Or right-click and select "Open with" your preferred browser

### Option 2: Run with a local server
For the best experience, you can run it with a local HTTP server:

#### Using Python (if you have Python installed):
```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Python 2
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```
Then open http://localhost:8000/final-entitlement-summary.html in your browser.

#### Using Node.js (if you have Node.js installed):
```bash
# Install a simple HTTP server globally
npm install -g http-server

# Run the server
http-server -p 8000
```
Then open http://localhost:8000/final-entitlement-summary.html in your browser.

#### Using PHP (if you have PHP installed):
```bash
php -S localhost:8000
```
Then open http://localhost:8000/final-entitlement-summary.html in your browser.
